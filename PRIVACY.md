# Privacy Policy — ChatMastery

**Effective Date**: 2026-02-13

ChatMastery does **not** collect, store, transmit, or sell any personal data.

## What the Extension Does

- Reads the content of ChatGPT webpages **locally in your browser** to build an on-page Table of Contents and calculate depth scores.
- Stores UI preferences (panel position, minimized state) and per-chat learning stats (question count, depth history) using `chrome.storage.local` — this data **never leaves your device**.

## What We Do NOT Do

- ❌ No data is sent to any external server
- ❌ No analytics or tracking of any kind
- ❌ No cookies or fingerprinting
- ❌ No third-party scripts or SDKs

## Permissions

| Permission | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `storage` | Save UI preferences and per-chat mastery stats locally |
| `host_permissions` (`chatgpt.com`, `chat.openai.com`) | Inject the ChatMastery panel into ChatGPT pages |

## Data Retention

All data is stored locally in your browser's extension storage. Uninstalling the extension removes all stored data.
